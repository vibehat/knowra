# Knowra Development Plan

> A comprehensive implementation roadmap for the Knowledge Database system

## Executive Summary

This development plan outlines the systematic implementation of Knowra, a Knowledge Database that models how understanding evolves from information to intuition. The plan follows a test-driven development (TDD) approach, implementing core functionality first with progressive enhancement through plugins.

### Core Principles
- **Test-First Development**: Every feature starts with failing tests
- **Progressive Complexity**: Basic functionality before intelligence
- **Graceful Degradation**: All features work without AI services
- **Incremental Delivery**: Ship working features early and often
- **Knowledge Evolution**: Information → Knowledge → Experience → Strategy → Intuition

### Development Timeline
- **Phase 1** (Week 1-2): Core Foundation - Information & Knowledge APIs
- **Phase 2** (Week 3-4): Experience & Learning System  
- **Phase 3** (Week 5-6): Strategy & Planning APIs
- **Phase 4** (Week 7-8): Intuition & Pattern Recognition
- **Phase 5** (Week 9-10): Plugin System & AI Enhancement
- **Phase 6** (Week 11-12): MCP Server & Integration Tools

**Total Duration**: 12 weeks for complete system with all knowledge levels
