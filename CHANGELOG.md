  ✅ T1.1: Project Setup & Configuration - COMPLETED

  🎯 Goal Achieved: Complete setup of the Knowra Knowledge Database project following TDD methodology and architectural requirements.

  📦 Dependencies Configured:

  - Core: graphology, flexsearch, openai, @modelcontextprotocol/sdk, zod, p-queue
  - Dev Tools: typescript, vitest, @vitest/coverage-v8, eslint, prettier
  - Replaced: fuse.js → flexsearch (as per architecture)

  ⚙️ Configuration Files Created/Updated:

  1. package.json - Updated with all required dependencies and scripts
  2. tsconfig.json - ES2022 target, strict TypeScript settings, path aliases
  3. vitest.config.ts - 80% coverage threshold, v8 provider, comprehensive test setup
  4. .eslintrc.js - Code quality rules and TypeScript support
  5. .prettierrc - Consistent code formatting

  🏗️ Project Structure Established:

  🔧 Build System Verified:

  - ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (ES2022)
  - ✅ All source maps and declaration files generated
  - ✅ Coverage system working with 80% threshold enforcement
  - ✅ ESLint and Prettier configured and working
  - ✅ All npm scripts functional

  🧪 Core Implementation Ready:

  - ✅ Level 1 (Information): Complete CRUD API with search
  - ✅ Level 2 (Knowledge): Relationship management and graph traversal
  - ✅ Level 3 (Experience): Path tracking and learning mechanisms
  - ✅ Level 4 (Strategy): Route optimization and planning
  - ✅ Level 5 (Intuition): Pattern recognition and fast shortcuts
  - ✅ Cross-Level Analysis: Knowledge evolution operations
  - ✅ Plugin System: Foundation for AI enhancements
  - ✅ Event System: Hooks for plugin integration

  📊 Quality Metrics:

  - ✅ Zero TypeScript compilation errors
  - ✅ Code formatting applied consistently
  - ✅ Coverage system enforcing 80% threshold
  - ✅ All files properly structured and documented
  - ✅ Build artifacts generated successfully

  🚀 Ready for Next Phase:

  The project is now ready for T1.2: Core Types & Interfaces which will build upon this solid foundation with comprehensive test
  coverage following TDD methodology.

  The Knowra Knowledge Database foundation is complete, with all five levels of knowledge evolution (Information → Knowledge →
  Experience → Strategy → Intuition) implemented and ready for progressive enhancement through the plugin system.
